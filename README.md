# Snake Game using SFML in C++

## Description
This is a simple Snake Game implemented in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. The game allows the player to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective of the game is to avoid collisions with the walls and with the snake's own body while trying to achieve the highest possible score.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay.
- Snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- Food spawns at random locations on the screen.
- Game over when the snake collides with itself.
- Display of the player's current score.
- Display of the player's highest score.
- Simple graphics and animations using SFML.

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake's movement.
2. The snake will continuously move in the direction you choose.
3. Your goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer.
4. Be careful not to run into the snake's own body, as this will restart the game.
5. Try to achieve the highest possible score before the game restarts.

## Dependencies
- SFML Library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library): Make sure to have SFML properly installed and configured in your project. You can find more information about SFML installation in the official SFML documentation.
